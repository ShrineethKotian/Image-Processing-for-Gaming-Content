Degradation Pipeline

Custom script to explore the best combinations and permutations of different degradations to apply on images to affect quality enough to make it simmilar to synthetic or game data(GTA V Images) and verify that by using Clean FID and KID (https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid).

The goal is to make FID and KID for Game vs Degraded Images better than Game vs Real Images.

Dataset used: BerkleyDeepDrive (BDD http://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/download.html) 10k Images
