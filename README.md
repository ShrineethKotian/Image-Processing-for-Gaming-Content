# Image-Processing-for-Gaming-Content
A 3-part pipeline to make synthetic game images more realistic using ISP, Super-Resolution, and GAN discriminators. Improves color, detail, and realism with FID/KID evaluation against Cityscapes.

# CV Praktikum – Photorealism Enhancement Pipeline

This repository contains a modular pipeline to enhance photorealism in synthetic video game imagery (GTA5) using three core components:

1. Image Signal Processing (ISP)

2. Super-Resolution (SR)

3. Lightweight Discriminator Models for GANs

Each branch contains code and documentation for one component, developed by a different team member.

## 📦 Structure
The project is split into three parts:

1. Neural Image Signal Processing (ISP) for Photorealism

Author: Shrineeth Kotian

Lightweight hybrid ISP pipeline that includes white balance, color correction, adaptive gamma, CLAHE, NILUT, vignette, sharpening, etc.

2. Enhancing Game Visuals using Super-Resolution and Image Restoration

Author: Ganesh Gopalakrishna 

Evaluation of SR models like RealESRGAN, SwinIR, StableSR, and NAFNET using synthetic degradation tailored for gaming imagery.

3. Lightweight Discriminator Architectures for Realism-Guided GANs

Author: Aishwarya Rao 

Benchmarking of efficient GAN discriminators (MobileNetV3, Swin-T, ConvNeXt, VGG) suitable for low-compute photorealism.

## ⚙️ Installation

To run the notebooks:


```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using NILUT:

Download pretrained NILUT weights from the official NILUT repo

Place them under ./models/weights/nilutx3style.pt or update the path in your code

For FID/KID metrics:
```bash
pip install clean-fid
```

Ensure that datasets (e.g., Playing for Data, Cityscapes) are downloaded and placed in the expected folders.

## 🚀 Running the Pipelines

Each team member’s code is self-contained in their branch:

branch: isp-pipeline → Shrineeth

branch: super-resolution → Ganesh

branch: gan-discriminators → Aishwarya

To test any pipeline:

Switch to the respective branch.

Open the .ipynb notebook file.

Follow the in-notebook instructions (dataset paths, parameters, model loading).

Output will be saved to /kaggle/working/ or configured path.

## 🧪 Evaluation

Evaluation is performed using FID and KID metrics with Cityscapes as the ground truth.

Consistent folder structure and image counts are used for fair comparison with previous baselines (CUT, MUNIT, Color Transfer).

Example:

```bash
FID (Raw GTA): ~120
FID (Final ISP): 53.5
```
